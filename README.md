# microblog-theme

A custom theme for Micro.blog, styled to resemble my [personal website](https://scotymax.com).

The following files contain hardcoded references to the domain or logos of the personal website.

- layouts/partials/header.html (svg logo)
- layouts/partials/footer.html (svg logo)
- layouts/post/single.html (regex to correct conversation js url value)
- static/assets/css/style.css (logo references)
- static/assets/js/scripts.js (cross-domain cookie to trigger light theme preference)
